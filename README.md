# Calorie Burnt Prediction

This project aims to develop a predictive model for estimating calorie expenditure during physical activities. Leveraging machine learning techniques, the model analyzes various input factors such as activity type, duration, intensity, and user biometric data to provide accurate predictions. 

## Features

- Utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms.
- Achieves an average accuracy of 98%.
- Average Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.47 calories.
- Empowers users to make informed decisions about their fitness goals.

## Usage

1. Open the `Calorie_Burnt_Prediction.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab.
2. Follow the instructions within the notebook to train and evaluate the model.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, xgboost)
